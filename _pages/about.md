My name is Jitin and I'm a double degree graduate student in Computational Engineering at **FAU, Erlangen-Nurnberg** and Computational Science at **USI, Lugano**. I have recently succesfully defended my master thesis supervised by <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=gEIEcVcAAAAJ&hl=en"> Dr. Juraj Kardos </a>, <a href="https://scholar.google.ch/olaf.schenk"> Prof. Dr. Olaf Schenk </a> and <a href="https://www.cs10.tf.fau.de/person/harald-koestler/"> Prof. Dr. Harald KÃ¶stler </a>. My thesis was titled "**Feasibility and Robustness of Machine Learning algorithms for calculating Locational Marginal Pricing**" where I explored the idea of using ML models for LMP prediction which is typically a solution of a convex-optimization problem. 
<br>
I have focused my studies on topics related to Machine Learning, High Performance Computing, Numerical Methods and Optimization Techniques. **I am currently on the lookout for possible PhD positions in the field of Applied ML.**
